# Image Classification PyTorch
There is Complete step by step process to train a model using transfer learning and classify images accordingly.

There are Two Files in the repository that are supported by Jupyter Notebook.
1. Train the model
2. Inference

To Train the model and get infoemation about the model regarding Accuracy and Loss
and Experiment on the model can download from the repository and can make changes 
and find the results of different changes one can use Train the model.ipynb

You can practice it with the following kaggle dataset: 
PlantVillage: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

To check the real time application of the model that you have trained test it out with different images 
in the file Inference.ipynb
